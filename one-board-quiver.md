### On Surfhood, Style, & the 1-Board Quiver

For what it’s worth, the idea isn’t about being a purist. 

It’s a response to overconsumption, rooted in sustainability and simplicity. The idea considers intentionally surfing one board, one shape, which in turn over time teaches patience, adaptability, and humility.  

Boards like the CI Mid or Grant Noble’s Wilbur and Homesick shapes exemplify this as being versatile, durable, and honest. They’re typically a mid-to-almost (7' plus) mini-log length with a 2+1 fin setup.

Think about it like this— the 1-board quiver is an experiment prioritizing **surfhood** and style in the water. It's not for everyone. It's an experience which doesn’t demand perfection because its about finding more in less.
